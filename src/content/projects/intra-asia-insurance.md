Intra Asia is a mobile app designed to make motor insurance claims simple, fast, and transparent for policyholders and surveyors. It focuses on clear steps, real-time updates, and a smooth experience from the moment a claim is initiated until it’s completed.

## Who the app is for

- Policyholders (Client): Individuals who want to submit and track their vehicle insurance claims.
- Surveyors: Field officers who schedule surveys, record results, and help move claims forward.

## What you can do with the app

- Start a claim in minutes: Enter your policy number, fill out guided questions, pin the incident location on a map, and upload photos or videos.
- Track claim progress: See your claim status and details at any time, so you always know what’s next.
- Choose a workshop: View the selected repair workshop and city associated with your claim.
- Get reminders and updates: Receive notifications about important steps and schedules.
- Surveyor tools: Surveyors can see their assigned schedules, filter by status (Open/Done), and submit or view survey results.

## How it works for Clients

1. Log in to your account.
2. Verify or add your policy number.
3. Start a claim: answer simple questions, pick a date and time, add photos/videos, and mark the incident location on the map.
4. Submit with confidence: the app guides you step-by-step and validates your inputs.
5. Track your claim: review claim details, status, and workshop information in the Overview and Claim Detail screens.

## How it works for Surveyors

1. Log in to your surveyor account.
2. Open Survey Schedule to view assigned claims.
3. Filter by status (Open/Done) and review claim details.
4. Submit survey results for open claims or view previous submissions.

## Helpful details
